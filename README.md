# MARATHON ☑☑
Marathon is a web application that I am currently working on to enhance the productivity and workflow of the average Joe. I am using React and Redux (Toolkit) for the frontend and for the backend, I plan on utilizing Node JS, Express JS, and MongoDB. Below, you will find a list of all the technologies and libraries that I intend to build Marathon with if you are interested in that. I will also be documenting every tiny detail or concept that I learn from building this project. You can find that below as well.

Marathon was inspired by Microsoft Todo. I have been a user of that application for a long time and as a challenge to myself, a full-stack developer, I decided to clone as much of it as I possibly can based on my current web development knowledge.

## TECHNOLOGIES AND LIBRARIES
01. HTML5
02. CSS3
03. JavaScript
04. React JS
05. React Router
06. Redux (Toolkit)
07. React Icons
08. React Menu
09. Ant Design
10. Date FNS
11. Axios
12. Node JS
13. Express JS
14. MongoDB
15. Mongoose
16. Netlify (hosting)

## LIVE DEMO
I do not have a live version of the project hosted yet but I will be sure to include a link as soon as I have built a good portion of the application. I plan on hosting the frontend on Netlify but the backend hosting solution is not decided yet.

## NEW CONCEPTS LEARNED
As of now, I have not learned anything new because I haven't even started working on the project properly but I will update this section as soon I have the related content ready.
